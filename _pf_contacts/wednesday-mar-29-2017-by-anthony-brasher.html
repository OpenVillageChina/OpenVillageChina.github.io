Your message: Hi, I'm part of a group working to create tools for decentralized decision making, I've been a huge fan of your work for a long time now. The reason I'm contacting you today is because a group we're partnering with has an opportunity that could prove mutually valuable. Their group is based on the idea of creating a proof of concept for digital direct democracy by creating a physical community wherein people live by it. (I'm working on a 'proof of concept' by making the digital tools they would need). The thing is creating 'Greenville' is going to also require the kind of technologies you're working on. They're going to need shelter and electricity, and nicely detailed plans to get people to buy in. I'm sure you're very busy and we'd hate to detract from all the good work you're doing out there. It's just that this would serve to increase your works publicity as well. Would you like to talk further?<br />
