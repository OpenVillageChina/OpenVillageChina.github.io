Your message: Awesome looking project - I found this on linuxtoday.com. I'm an IT Engineer (Linux and systems) as well as working towards transitioning full time to being a farmer with a focus on aquaponics. I would love to see aquaponics worked into this project! Being able to take advantage of vertical space is a key in this. As soon as the weather warms up, my family and I will be getting our 32' geodesic greenhouse built and our first aquaponics system up and running. I'd be quite happy to work with you all as well as point you all in directions of very professional aquaponics people to make a more perfect system.<br />
