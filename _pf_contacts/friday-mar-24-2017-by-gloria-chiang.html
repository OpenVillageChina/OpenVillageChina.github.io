<p>Your Name: Gloria Chiang<br />

Subject: Would like to contribute<br />
Your message: Hi there, I found out about Open Village through my buddy Jon who was at Fossasia and I would like to help and be involved. I'm from Singapore but spent over 7 years in Beijing, for starters I could help with simple English to Chinese translation (I'm better at Chinese to English). I was a creative technologist for Ai Weiwei for about two years previously and hope to contribute to Open Village in one way or another. My WeChat mobile number is 13161906391 and my GitHub username is keymistress. Hope to hear from you. Best regards, Gloria<br />
