Subject: A complementary project to look at<br />
Your message: I was watching Alex Cureton-Griffiths giving his presentation on the open source village, and it reminded me of something I'd read about previously. Some head-scratching and a bit of searching later, I found this: http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs/ Seems these people are working on a "global village construction set"--intended to be cheap, readily built open source machines. Their descroption, "The Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) is a modular, DIY, low-cost, high-performance platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50 different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a small, sustainable civilization with modern comforts. Weâ€™re developing open source industrial machines that can be made at a fraction of commercial costs, and sharing our designs online for free." Now, browsing through, it seems like they've got about 8 of these 50 planned machines to a usable state--it is after all a pretty ambitious goal--but some of them seem quite basic and useful. One of the eight is a form of housing, which isn't really a machine. However, the house thing is built using blocks of compressed earth which in turn are made with the "CEB press" that they have already made. So that's pretty cool. They are apparently aware of the Wikihouse that Alex mentioned in the talk and are considering incorporating some elements. Anyway, these people seemed like just the sort you could work with and developing just the sort of open source tech you could draw on to make the open source village. Maybe you already know all about them, but I thought I'd mention them. Cheers, Rufus Polson<br />
