Subject: Collaborate Self Build Project Konko Village Ghana West Africa<br />
Your message: My name is Jim King from the state of North Carolina USA. As Project Director, I have been working with a company known as Goulborn Resources in Konko Village, Ghana West Africa, This area is within 15 minutes of Koforidua which is the capatil of the Eastern Region. Through some personal reasons that I will be happy to discuss at a later date, fate brought me to a re-play of Wikihouse co-founder,Alistar, on Ted Talks recently. That led me to discover you and your work in selfbuild and having developed your Open Village Group I am beginning the process of building a project which would start out as approximately a 20-25 home area of affordable housing for this area, as of now nothing like this exists. I know that the idea of SelfProvided housing would gain a strong foothold in this area of the world. We have the land, good level land with few trees and only shrub and brush to clear, excellent water and proximity to good work and markets. Of course, those terms are relative in Ghana. I have looked at the half house possibility, I love your video on the 6 unit concept with a basement commons room. Overall, I am needing direction on how to best approach this as to types of structure and solid advanced planning for sustained development. Assistance in securing experienced planners/developers familiar with the Wikihouse design principles. As your group has stated, homes that communities can build for themselves. To be frank, I need your assistance with the entire project but as always, the money is to be raised even though I do not feel it is an obstacle at all. We have already developed a lot of interest from a variety of persons in all walks of business. I would appreciate scheduling say a Skype conference call or a regular call to further pursue your assistance and how we might best work together. I see the community build as a goal in all of this and depend on it as an economic necessity. I also want to discuss anything you might have on off-grid power and sewage treatment. Not sure it will be a part of the project but if that can be introduced into this area, we might well see it spread to the social and economic benefit for the area. I know this is a project that requires many experienced people involved to make sure all available funds are properly spent and a return to sustain it's growth is realized. Along side this housing project, we are in the early stages of getting the permission to begin working toward providing good jobs in the same area near to good housing by building a Pure Water bottling plant. There are no such bottlers in the east or north of Ghana and none across to the western part of Nigeria. As you may know, good clean water is a consistent problem for this entire region. All bottlers are in the Ghana Capital of Accura and little is distributed in this market. I am going too long for an email, please pardon me. I look forward to speaking with you personally.
