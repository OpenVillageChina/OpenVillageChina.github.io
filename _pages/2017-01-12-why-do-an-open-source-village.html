<h3>Clean and Green Living</h3>
<p>Currently urban centres occupy less than 5% of the world’s landmass but account for around 70% of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. The pace of urbanization is rapidly increasing, and new ways of building and planning are required. We're starting small with a village to test out new ways of doing things and providing better lives for citizens.</p>
<h3>Technology Testing Ground</h3>
<p>There are already so many fantastic open technologies out there that make the world a better place. We want to help designers and makers test in real-world conditions and scale their projects from one or two to something that works on a village-wide scale.</p>
<h3>Inspirational Destination</h3>
<p>Open eco-friendly technologies sound great in principle, but it's only when you go somewhere and see them in action that it really drives home what a difference they can make. Our village is that place.</p>
<h3>Opportunities for All</h3>
<p>Locking away our technology goes against making the world a better place. We want to get our tools into the hands of the people, so we use <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open source</a> licenses. That means all of our technologies and tools are free for you to use, share, translate and remix (and sometimes use commercially.)</p>
