<h2>Problems faced by the village</h2>
<p>Hao Tang Village is facing the problem of tourism and community.For community,the support of local government has been weakening gradually.Hao Tang has been developing in a high speed since 2011 with the strong support government,local authority and village leaders.However,nowadays Hao Tang is a pattern of “rural development” more than the target which government highly concerned. As a result,villagers feel unsafe and they are unwilling to take actions.The key solution is to help the villagers to build the thought and competence of independent development.</p>
<p>The main problem of tourism is homogenization since the pattern can be replicated easily and at low price.At the same time,it faces the problem of the tourists’ source shortage which is considered to be linked with the brand stratages of Hao Tang.To be specific,the tourists are mainly from He Nan Province(Xin Yang,Zhu Ma Dian,Zhen Zhou and nearby areas) who have specific objection and expectation such as peasant meal,fruit picking,family excursion and so on.Their consumption is mainly on catering and its by-product.However almost all of these “expectation” mentioned above can be provided by ordinary Farmhouse near the cities.What makes the Hao Tang maintains its competitiveness are its reputation and environment.Therefore, the differentiation of tourism development, is the key to find path of sustainable development.</p>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<h3>Short-term</h3>
<p>More and more young people have left cities for their hometown and they are making efforts on the development of Hao Tang.</p>
<h3>Medium-term</h3>
<p>The Local NGO are trying to build a virtual community so that the resources and information can be exchanged freely among villagers.If the idea can be turned into reality,it will not not only avoid the obstacle of communication,but also open up the minds of villagers.</p>
<p>The Village Leaders and Local NGO expects to plan a stationary bazaar on the villager in order to regulate the current market .</p>
<p>The NGO is preparing to provide some course for the dwellings managers which can help them command the basic knowledge of network marketing.</p>
<h3>Long-term</h3>
<p>The tourism is likely to get out of the bottleneck and realize the diversity development.</p>
