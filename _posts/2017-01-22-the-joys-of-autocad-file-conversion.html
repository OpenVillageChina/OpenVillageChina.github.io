<p>After several days in front of a computer, with much wailing and gnashing of teeth, we've got the <a href="https://github.com/OpenVillageChina/site-survey" target="_blank">site surveys</a> ready for anyone who wants to use them!</p>
<h3>The Struggle is Real</h3>
<p>Getting the files looking and playing nice was a whole struggle in itself. We're a multinational team, and many of us are still learning <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">what this whole Open Source thing is</a>. I'm a Brit trying to communicate with the Chinese CAD designer through a middle-man, switching between English and Mandarin to explain what I need. Thankfully certain things like DWG, DXF, and SHX don't need translation!</p>
<p>Most of the work involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting the proprietary <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview">AutoCAD</a> DWG (DraWinG) files to the open DXF (Drawing eXchange Format). This entailed dusting off an old copy of AutoCAD and getting it to play nicely on my HiDPI screen. Note: If you value your sanity and patience, don't run AutoCAD on a Microsoft Surface or other low-spec machine. You can practically hear the CPU groaning away.</li>
<li>Getting a bunch of missing <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/fileformat/SHX-Shape-entities-AutoCAD">SHX</a> files from...well, wherever I could find them. Most of them were only available from dodgy-looking Chinese download sites, and Chrome didn't want (or even allow) me to open the files I downloaded. Luckily Microsoft Edge came to the rescue. Thank you disregard for user safety!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What still needs to be done?</h3>
<p>I can see the next few days being a barrel of laughs as I go from being a fresh-faced CAD novice to a bitter and twisted CAD burnout. I'll be working on trying to get the DXF file looking nice in open-source alternatives to AutoCAD. The file should look like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-210" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017-01-18-14_23_09--e1484702249274-900x1024.png" alt="" width="640" height="728" /></p>
<p>But in FreeCAD it looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-211" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017-01-18-14_21_21--e1484702318493-952x1024.png" alt="" width="640" height="688" /></p>
<h3>How could we improve this process?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, closed-source software like AutoCAD is the industry standard. Sure, we could push everyone at the organization to run <a href="http://www.freecadweb.org">FreeCAD</a>, but we're trying to balance real-world practicality with open-source philosophy. Maybe someday we'll make that transition, but we've got more pressing things at hand right now.</p>
<p>I've downloaded all the missing SHX files that were referenced in the original DWG file and put them in one folder. I'd provide a link but I have no idea of the license these things are released under.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-212" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2017-01-18-14_35_04-Fonts-1024x295.png" alt="" width="640" height="184" /></p>
<p>That should help in the future, and I'd like to get the designer to ship any further SHXes they use. In the meantime, I found a big zip files of SHXes so hopefully that'll contain anything that's missing.</p>
