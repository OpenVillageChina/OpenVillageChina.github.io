<p>We're releasing a bunch of articles about open source in ebook format for you to read on your Kindle or other device. They're just existing articles about open source from around the web (that are freely licensed to share), so quite short and snappy compared to a full-length book.<!--more--></p>
<p>Why? Sitting in front of a glowing screen all day can wreck your eyesight, so reading lots of stuff is much healthier on a dedicated ebook reader.</p>
<p>You can find the books in our <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mgpiqhb6pb0tlk8/AACtFPpw5hoqyiuwc-BxSvNZa?dl=0">Dropbox folder</a>. Since they're under open licenses (mostly Creative Commons), feel free to share, translate, etc etc!</p>
